\section{Abstract}
\indent As we know, Internet companies often launch some campaigns to acquire new users or reserve old users.
So how to improve these users' s retention rate has become an important issue.In this project we will
design a new user guide by analyzing the users behavior log data to help improve it.Below are one music app new users' natural retention rate curve and improved curve after operation campaign.

\caption{An example of improvement of retetion rate }
\label{fig:label1}
\end{figure}

\section{Data source and structure}
Our data is from Mozat Singapore's mobile broadcast app Loops's database.
We have used the users' basic information and behavior log,which includes 3000W records.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\label{fig:label2}
\end{figure}


\section{Definition and Benchmark}
\indent Nine users' behavior includes:watch live,
send chat,send gift,go to upcoming,register upcoming,
go to explore center,enter my level.
These users need to do the behavior in his first
online time cause we need to analyze the influence to the retention rate of the first time's click.

\indent Retention rate:We need to account all new users'
retention ratio and users' who had
done the behavior active ratio in
one month separately. If a user is online one day we
account 1 active point in one day
Then we use the accumulated point
divided by the number of users
We can get the one month's retention ratio.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{How to difine he retention rate}
\label{fig:label3}
\end{figure}

And another question:how to divide people
who had been familiar with broadcast platform
and who originally have high retention rate and
who are motivated by the behavior?In order
to reduce the influence of these people
we remove these people who had given gift in one month.
We think them as people
who originally have high retention rate.

\section{Result and conclusion}
\indent Below three figures are the final result what we get.
Behavior of same dimension has been put into same figure.\\

\section{Strategy}
\begin{enumerate}
\incent \item Encourage broadcasters to welcome the new users in policy.
Then watcher is more likely to interactive with broadcasters like send chat.
(broadcaster guide)
\incent \item First ten message rewards like experience to help user achieve level 2 more quickly.\\
\incent \item New user guide to force new users to send chat.
\end{enumerate}
